## This python script will automatically DM you a list of People who do not follow you back on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fake_friend_identifier/)

## What exactly is Fake friend Identifier?
- I have created a page [fake_friend_identifier](https://www.instagram.com/fake_friend_identifier/) on instagram
- Follow this account and accept the follow back request (This will make sure that the the list of followers and following is visible to this parent account)
- This account will then automatically DM you a clickable list of people who dont follow you back

## Advantages of this script over traditional third party applications on play store:
- These applications ask for your username an password.
- Your Privacy is at risk
- Fake friend identifier just requires you to follow [this](https://www.instagram.com/fake_friend_identifier/) account.
- You are not obliged to share your password!
